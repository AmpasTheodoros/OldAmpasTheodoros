# OldAmpasTheodoros

This repository contains the source code for my old personal website, which was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website includes information about me, my skills, and my projects.

## Getting Started

To view the website, simply clone or download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Features

- The website includes a homepage with a brief introduction and a photo of me.
- The website includes a skills section where I list my technical and non-technical skills.
- The website includes a projects section where I showcase some of my past projects and provide links to view them.
- The website includes a contact form where visitors can send me a message.
- The website is responsive and will adjust to fit different screen sizes.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to update the website with a new design and additional features such as:

- The ability for visitors to view my resume and CV.
- The ability for visitors to see my latest blog posts and articles.
